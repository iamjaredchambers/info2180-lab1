 <h2>Jared Chambers</h2>
 <p>20. Passionate. Coder. Christian. These are the terms that define me: Jared Chambers. I love curry chicken and white rice. In my opinion, this is the best combination of food on earth right now! I just wish the world was a better place you know? It sucks that we have so much hate, anger and selfishness in our globe today. We can do better (with God on our side). Don't you think?</p>
