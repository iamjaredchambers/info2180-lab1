 <h2>Jared Chambers</h2>
 <p>20. Passionate. Coder. Christian. These are the terms that define me: Jared Chambers. I love curry chicken and white rice. In my opinion, this is the best combination of food on earth right now! I just wish the world was a better place you know? It sucks that we have so much hate, anger and selfishness in our globe today. We can do better (with God on our side). Don't you think?ls</p>
 Why am I interested in Web Development? Well, It started in 10th grade where I created my first html site that was to advertise a barber shop. I thought it was fun and so cool how I could type one little script and then all these colors popped up. It is pretty cool. I wanted to always pursue it, plus I know it is good to know these languages if I am hacking so I decided to do it.</main>
